LangChain, an open-source framework for LLM RAG development.
It combines LLM's broad knowledge with external up to date information 
Key features of LangChain
1. Document loaders for various data formats
2. Text splitters for large documents
3. Efficient vector stores
4. Embeddings for vector representation
5. Flexible component integration
6. Support for multiple LLM's

LangChain provides a structured framework for integrating various components like loaders, splitters, and retrievers, making the development of RAG applications more efficient and modular.
